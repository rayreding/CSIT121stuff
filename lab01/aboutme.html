            <p>
                Hello, My name is Ahmed.
                I am a college student, which means I have a lot of free time but no time to waste at the same time.
                I find myself rushing to meet deadlines, stay ahead of the workload, catch up on my studies at times 
                but then again some days I am just wondering what to do. I believe that's the beauty of college life. 
                Apart from college, I run my own business. It's a small service providing business. It's early to talk
                about yet but I'm giving it my best with every time I have left from college.

             I major in Information System. This semester I am taking four courses including this class. The other three
             are Intro to Management System, Introduction to Cybersecurity, and Visual Basic Programming.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                I'm quite passionate about motorsports. I've been fascinated by the accuracy and rush of racing since I was
                a little child, spending my weekends visiting nearby raceways or watching Formula 1 events. I like working 
                on vehicles hands-on, learning about performance tuning and engine mechanics, and daydreaming of driving a 
                track one day. I use the lessons I've learned about attention, dedication, and pushing boundaries to both 
                my personal and academic life.
